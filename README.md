# ☘️ Open Feis

**A modern, local-first Irish Dance competition management platform.**

Open Feis is an open-source alternative to legacy feis management systems. Built with resilience at its core, it guarantees data integrity and operational continuity—even during internet outages. No more "tabulation meltdowns."

### Architecture Philosophy: "The Monolith on a Stick"

We reject microservices complexity. Open Feis runs as a single deployable unit:
- One Python process
- One SQLite file  
- One static frontend build

This approach is easy to deploy, debug, and costs under $10/month.

## 🔐 Authentication

Open Feis uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication with bcrypt password hashing.

### User Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| `super_admin` | Full access to everything (admin, judging, all features) |
| `organizer` | Create/manage feiseanna, generate syllabus, manage entries |
| `adjudicator` | Access Judge Pad, submit scores |
| `teacher` | View results, manage school dancers (coming soon) |
| `parent` | Register dancers, view results |

### How It Works

1. **Registration** — New users register with email/password (default role: `parent`)
2. **Login** — Users receive a JWT token valid for 24 hours
3. **Protected Routes** — Backend validates token and checks role permissions
4. **Frontend UI** — Navigation and features adapt based on user role

### Security Features

- **Password Hashing** — bcrypt with automatic salting
- **JWT Tokens** — Stateless authentication, no server-side sessions
- **Role Enforcement** — Backend rejects unauthorized requests regardless of frontend
- **Demo Mode** — Unauthenticated users can explore UI but cannot submit data

---

## 📧 Email Setup (Resend)

Open Feis uses [Resend](https://resend.com) for transactional emails (verification, notifications). Resend offers **3,000 free emails/month** on their free tier.

### Why Resend?

- **Modern API** — Simple, developer-friendly REST API
- **Free Tier** — 3,000 emails/month at no cost
- **Works Everywhere** — Same behavior locally and in production
- **No SMTP** — No need to configure mail servers

### Setup Instructions

#### Step 1: Create a Resend Account

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and sign up
2. Navigate to [API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys) and create a new key
3. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

#### Step 2: Verify Your Domain

1. Go to [Domains](https://resend.com/domains) in Resend
2. Click "Add Domain" and enter your sending domain (e.g., `mail.yourdomain.com`)
3. Add the DNS records Resend provides:
   - **DKIM** — TXT record for email authentication
   - **SPF** — MX and TXT records for sender verification
4. Wait for verification (usually instant to a few minutes)

> **Tip:** Use a subdomain like `mail.yourdomain.com` to keep your main domain's DNS clean.

#### Step 3: Configure Open Feis

1. Log in as a **Super Admin** (e.g., `admin@openfeis.org`)
2. Go to **Admin** → **Settings**
3. Enter your configuration:
   - **Resend API Key:** Your `re_...` API key
   - **From Email:** Must match your verified domain (e.g., `Open Feis <noreply@mail.yourdomain.com>`)
   - **Site URL:** Your production URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`) or `http://localhost:5173` for local dev
4. Click **Save Settings**

The status badge will change from "Not Configured" to "Configured" ✅

### Local Development

For local testing, you have two options:

**Option 1: Use Resend's Test Sender**
- Set From Email to: `Delivered <onboarding@resend.dev>`
- Emails will be sent but may go to spam

**Option 2: Skip Email Configuration**
- Leave the API key empty
- The app works without email — verification is skipped
- Users can still register and log in

### How Email Verification Works

1. User registers → verification email is sent (if configured)
2. User clicks link in email → email is verified
3. A banner shows for unverified users with a "Resend email" button
4. Verification links expire after 24 hours
5. Resending is rate-limited to once per 60 seconds

## 🧮 Irish Points Scoring Logic

Open Feis implements the official CLRG (An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha) scoring system.

### Conversion Table

| Place | Points | Place | Points |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1st | 100 | 6th | 53 |
| 2nd | 75 | 7th | 50 |
| 3rd | 65 | 8th | 47 |
| 4th | 60 | 9th | 45 |
| 5th | 56 | 10th | 43 |

Points continue to decrease until 50th place (1 point). 51st+ receive 0 points.

### Tie-Breaking (Split Points)

When dancers tie for a placement:
1. Sum the points for all tied positions
2. Divide by the number of tied dancers
3. Each tied dancer receives the averaged points

**Example:** Two dancers tie for 2nd place
- Points available: 75 (2nd) + 65 (3rd) = 140
- Each dancer receives: 140 ÷ 2 = **70 points**
- Next dancer is ranked 4th (60 points)

### Drop High/Low (5-Judge Panels)

For major championships with 5 judges:
1. Calculate Irish Points from each judge independently
2. For each dancer, identify the highest and lowest point totals
3. Discard these outliers
4. Sum the remaining 3 scores for final placement

### Competition Age (January 1st Rule)

A dancer's competition age is their age as of **January 1st of the competition year**, not their current age. This is standard across Irish Dance organizations.

### Prerequisites

- A Linux server (Debian/Ubuntu recommended)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A domain name pointed to your server's IP
- Ports 80 and 443 open in your firewall

### Step 1: Provision a Server

**Google Cloud Platform (Free Tier):**
```bash
# Create an e2-micro instance (free tier eligible)
gcloud compute instances create openfeis-server \
  --machine-type=e2-micro \
  --zone=us-east1-c \
  --image-family=debian-12 \
  --image-project=debian-cloud \
  --boot-disk-size=30GB \
  --tags=http-server,https-server

# Reserve a static IP
gcloud compute addresses create openfeis-ip --region=us-east1
```

**Other options:** DigitalOcean ($4/mo), Hetzner (€3.79/mo), or any VPS provider.

### Step 2: Install Docker

```bash
# SSH into your server
gcloud compute ssh openfeis-server --zone=us-east1-c

# Install Docker (Debian/Ubuntu)
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

# Verify installation
docker --version
docker compose version
```

### Step 3: Clone and Configure

```bash
# Create app directory
sudo mkdir -p /opt/openfeis
sudo chown $USER:$USER /opt/openfeis
cd /opt/openfeis

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OpenFeis/openfeis-server.git .

# Edit the Caddyfile to use YOUR domain
nano Caddyfile
# Replace "openfeis.org" with your domain name
```

**Example Caddyfile for your domain:**
```
yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy app:8000
    encode gzip zstd
}

www.yourdomain.com {
    redir https://yourdomain.com{uri} permanent
}
```

### Step 4: Deploy

```bash
# Build and start the containers
docker compose up -d --build

# Check that everything is running
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f
```

### Step 5: Verify

Visit `https://yourdomain.com` — you should see the Open Feis homepage with a valid SSL certificate!

**Default admin credentials:**
- Email: `admin@openfeis.org`
- Password: `admin123`

> ⚠️ **Important:** Change the admin password immediately after first login!

### Updating

To deploy updates from GitHub:

```bash
cd /opt/openfeis
./deploy.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
git pull origin main
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
docker image prune -f
```

### Deployment Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Dockerfile` | Multi-stage build (Node for frontend, Python for backend) |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Orchestrates Caddy + App containers |
| `Caddyfile` | Reverse proxy config with automatic HTTPS |
| `.dockerignore` | Excludes unnecessary files from Docker build |
| `deploy.sh` | One-command deployment script |

### Infrastructure Costs

| Component | Specification | Cost |
|-----------|--------------|------|
| Compute | GCP `e2-micro` (2 vCPU, 1GB RAM) | Free tier |
| Storage | 30GB SSD | Free tier |
| SSL | Caddy + Let's Encrypt | Free |
| Email | Resend (3,000 emails/month) | Free tier |
| **Total** | | **$0/month** |

### Scaling Strategy

1. **Start:** `e2-micro` with swap enabled
2. **If RAM > 80%:** Upgrade to `e2-small` (2GB RAM, ~$13/mo)
3. **High traffic:** Add Cloudflare for CDN + DDoS protection (free tier)

### Backup & Recovery

The SQLite database is stored in a Docker volume (`openfeis_data`). To backup:

```bash
# Create a backup
docker compose exec app cp /data/openfeis.db /data/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).db

# Copy backup to local machine
docker cp openfeis-app-1:/data/backup-*.db ./backups/
```

**Planned:** Litestream integration for real-time streaming backups to cloud storage.
